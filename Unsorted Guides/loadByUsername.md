The provided Java code demonstrates an implementation of Spring Security's `UserDetailsService` interface and how it integrates into a JWT-based authentication filter. Let's break down the functionality step-by-step and explain its role in user authentication, especially in relation to the `loadUserByUsername` method.

### 1. `UserDetailsService` Implementation

```java
@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
    return username -> userRepository.findByEmail(username)
        .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found"));
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **UserDetailsService**: This is a core interface in Spring Security that allows you to load user-specific data. In this case, it's implemented using a lambda expression.
- **Purpose**: The method is designed to load user information based on the username (in this case, an email address). The `UserDetailsService` interface requires an implementation of the `loadUserByUsername` method, which returns a `UserDetails` object containing the user's credentials and authorities.
- **userRepository.findByEmail(username)**: Here, `userRepository` is likely a data access layer (probably a Spring Data JPA repository) that interacts with the database to find a user by email. This `findByEmail` method is expected to return an `Optional<User>`.
- **Exception Handling**: If no user is found with the provided email, a `UsernameNotFoundException` is thrown. This exception is important for the authentication process, as Spring Security relies on it to determine whether the user exists or not.

### 2. `JwtAuthenticationFilter` Integration

The `UserDetailsService` is utilized within the `JwtAuthenticationFilter` class, which processes each request to verify the user's JWT token.

```java
@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class JwtAuthenticationFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

    private final JwtService jwtService;
    private final UserDetailsService userDetailsService;

    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(
        @NonNull HttpServletRequest request,
        @NonNull HttpServletResponse response,
        @NonNull FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException {

        final String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");
        final String jwt;
        final String userEmail;

        // Step 1: Extract JWT token from the Authorization header
        if (authHeader == null || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
            filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
            return;
        }

        jwt = authHeader.substring(7);
        userEmail = jwtService.extractUsername(jwt);

        // Step 2: Validate token and user
        if (userEmail != null && SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() == null) {

            // Step 3: Load the user using the UserDetailsService
            UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(userEmail);

            // Step 4: Validate the token against the user
            if (jwtService.isTokenValid(jwt, userDetails)) {
                UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authToken = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(
                    userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());
                authToken.setDetails(
                    new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request)
                );

                // Step 5: Set the authentication in the security context
                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken);
            }
        }

        // Step 6: Continue with the filter chain
        filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **Purpose**: The `JwtAuthenticationFilter` class extends `OncePerRequestFilter`, meaning it is invoked once per HTTP request. It is responsible for checking the incoming JWT token in the `Authorization` header of requests and setting the authentication in the Spring Security context.
- **JwtService**: This service handles extracting and validating JWT tokens. The method `jwtService.extractUsername(jwt)` retrieves the username (or email in this case) from the JWT.
- **authHeader Handling**: The filter first checks if the `Authorization` header contains a valid Bearer token. If the header is missing or improperly formatted, it simply continues the filter chain without attempting authentication.
  
  - **Token Extraction**: If a valid Bearer token is found, the JWT is extracted (removing the `Bearer ` prefix) and passed to `jwtService.extractUsername(jwt)` to get the associated user email.
  
  - **UserDetailsService**: Once the user's email is extracted from the JWT, the `userDetailsService` is called to load the user's details using the `loadUserByUsername` method. This integrates the custom `UserDetailsService` implementation provided earlier, where the user is fetched by their email.

  - **Token Validation**: After loading the user, the JWT token is validated using `jwtService.isTokenValid(jwt, userDetails)`. If the token is valid, a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is created with the user's credentials and authorities, which are used to authenticate the user in the Spring Security context.

  - **Setting SecurityContext**: Finally, the filter sets the `SecurityContextHolder` with the authenticated token, allowing the request to proceed as authenticated.

### Key Flow:

1. **JWT Extraction**: The filter retrieves the JWT from the Authorization header.
2. **User Details Loading**: The `UserDetailsService` is used to fetch user details based on the email extracted from the JWT.
3. **Authentication**: If the token is valid and the user exists, the user's authentication is set in the Spring Security context.
